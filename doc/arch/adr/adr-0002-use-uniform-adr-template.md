## Context

When documenting decisions there is need to record background information (context),
but it should be kept minimum and well organized.

Actions (decision) and resulting changes (consequences, tradeoffs) need to be made visible.

For uniform format, clarity and ease to record information a template document is needed.

## Decision

We will use Decision record template by Michael Nygard.

We can extend template when needed, but there shouldn't never be need to drop any part of template completely.

## Consequences

Each relevant decision needs to be identified, named, recorded and peer reviewed by persons
or roles which are affected by decision.

Changing decisions is easier, as decisions are known and forces / tradeoffs related to them are recorded.

Future developers feel themselves welcomed, as we have already invested time to them 
and prepared for them answers to questions they face when involved with project.

Disciplined approach to decision making needs continuous attention, 
or process of evolving architecture together as team (read: agile architecture) starts to erode.
